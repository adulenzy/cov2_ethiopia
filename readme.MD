# COVID-19 statistics updates at Telegram

## How it works

It gets data from https://github.com/pomber/covid19, and makes it available in a channel on Telegram via [Telegram Actions](https://github.com/appleboy/telegram-action).

You can enter the [channel for Ethiopia](http://t.me/cov2_eth) to see the updates.

## Extending

To extend this project for you country you can fork and replace the `TELEGRAM_TO` secret in your repository, using the channel id for it.
